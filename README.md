# Encrer
A Visual Novel System for Unity that uses Inky allowing for Indie Devs to easily import a Dialogue System into their Games. 

**Encrer in Unity**
For using Encrer for a full project in Unity please download the required project .zip file then simply open Unity Hub, select the project files as a new file and then run the project. Set up will only require adding images and the Inky File. Be sure to delete the Godot Files in the GEncrer Folder or else there will be an issue on bootup.
For an indirect port, you can use as little or as many files as you want from Encrer.
If you have any ideas for improvement feel free to make a fork, ill try to merge it. 
If you do end up using Encrer it would be greatly appreciated if you credit the project in the credits somewhere to help other indie devs find it (not required though) 

**Encrer in Godot**
Encrer in Godot is still a Work In Progress, and doesnt currently work. To help to improve and organize its functionality will be greatly appreciated :D
