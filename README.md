# Encrer
A Visual Novel System for Unity and Godot that uses Inky

**Encrer in Unity**
For using the Encrer in Unity Build, please download the required project files then simply open Unity Hub, select the project files as a new file and then run the project. Set up will only require adding images and the Inky File. Be sure to delete the Godot Files in the GEncrer Folder.
For an indirect port, you can use as little or as many files as you want from Encrer.
If you have any ideas for improvement feel free to make a fork, ill try to merge it.

**Encrer in Godot**
Encrer in Godot is still a Work In Progress, any help to improve and organize its functionality will be greatly appreciated :D
